# Global Rules for the AI Assistant

## 🔄 Project Awareness and Context

- Always read `PLANNING.md` at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's goals, architecture, and constraints.
- Check `TASK.md` before starting a new task to understand what needs to be done.

## 📁 Code Structure and Modularity

- Never create files with more than 200 lines of code. If a file approaches this limit, refactor it by splitting it into smaller, reusable modules.
- Organize directories by responsibility:
    - Place all reusable UI components in `src/components/`.
    - Store page-level components and route definitions in `src/pages/`.
    - Keep global and modular CSS or style files in `src/styles/`.
    - Store static assets such as images in `src/assets/`.
    - Use `src/layouts/` for layout components that wrap pages or sections.
    - Place business logic, utilities, and pure functions in `src/utils/` or `src/services/` as appropriate.
- Ensure each directory contains only files relevant to its responsibility, avoiding cross-purpose mixing.
- Structure should be clear and scalable as the project grows.

## 🧾 Naming and Readability

- Use highly descriptive names for functions, variables, and files, even if they become long (e.g., `create-rss-feed-from-blog-posts.ts`).
- Avoid abbreviations. Prefer `handleUserAuthentication` over `handleAuth`.
- File names should use kebab-case (e.g., `example-file-name.ts`).

## 🧪 Testing and Reliability

- Always create unit tests for new features.
- Write pure functions whenever possible to simplify testing.
- Extract business logic from UI components into reusable and testable functions in `src/utils/` or `src/services/`.

## 💬 Comments and Documentation

- Comment only on the "why" of a code decision, not the "how." Comments should be written in English.
- Use JSDoc only for complex functions or shared utilities.

## 🔐 Security and Configuration

- Store all keys, secrets, and configurations in `.env`, with an example file `.env.example`.
- Create a helper to validate environment variables during application initialization, if necessary.
